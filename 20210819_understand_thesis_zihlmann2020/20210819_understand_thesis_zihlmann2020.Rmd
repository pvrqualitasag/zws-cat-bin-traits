# Theory
This chapter summarises chapter 2 of `r met$add("Zihlmann2020")` and gives some more details on the context of the thesis. Chapter 2 of the thesis starts with an outline of some concepts of quantitative genetics. Here, we want to first give a short description of livestock breeding which is the main motivation of our practical work.

## Livestock Breeding
The term `Livestock Breeding` is often used ambiguously. Very often not sharp distinction between animal husbandry, livestock production and livestock breeding is drawn. In the context of this document, the term `Livestock Breeding` is defined as follows.

```{definition, name: Livestock Breeding, label=livestockbreeding}
Livestock Breeding improves livestock populations at the level of their genetic architecture. Improvement is meant with respect to a pre-defined breeding goal.
```

A breeding goal consists of a set of characteristics or properties - also referred to as traits - of the livestock animals that are desirable for the owner. Since most livestock owners of animals base their economic outcome on selling animal products, the desirability of the traits is closely associated with the profitability of an agricultural enterprise. From the point of view of agricultural economics, livestock animals are production factors and belong to the capital of the enterprise. The production process within the livestock animal enterprise use inputs such as forage, water, housing, veterinary care, labor and others to produce output such as milk, meat, offspring animals and other products. The factors in the input category must be bought and create costs. All products in the output category can be sold and therebye create revenue or income. The difference between revenue and costs is profit which the enterprise can use for investments. 

```{r livestock-production-system, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/livestock-production-system.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/livestock-production-system.png")
```

To preserve profitability of a livestock production enterprise, the whole system must constantly be improved. Improvements to the livestock production system can be made at different levels. One type of improvements can be done as short term measures to constantly try to optimize the every-day production process. These measures can include

* avoiding wasted resources
* optimal quality control when buying input factors
* seeking for good conditions and low costs when buying input factors
* finding good clients which pay a high price for the product
* treat animals with respect and with good care to avoid illnesses to keep veterinary costs low and to guarantee a high level of production with a good quality.

Besides these short-term improvements, there are also a number of long-term measures available that help to have good profitability of the livestock production enterprise. One of these long-term meansures consist of the improvement of the genetic architecture of the livestock animals. The term `genetic architecture` stands for the completeness of the genetic information of any given animal. That information in encoded in a molecule called DNA and can be found in every cell of a livestock animal. 

Why the genetic arcchitecture of the livestock animals is important for the livestock production enterprise, is described in one of the following sections on Quantitative Genetics. An important statement that we can make at this point is that animals with an improved genetic architecture are more productive, can produce more efficiently, are healthier due to their improved adaptation to their environment and have a reduced ecological footprint.

As seen in the previous section, with respect to a long term planning horizon of a livestock enterprise it is important to improve the genetic architecture of the livestock animals. The main question now is how can we improve the genetic architecture of a population of livestock animals? This question will be answered in the following section on quantitative genetics.


## Quantitative Genetics
Livestock animals show considerable variation in the measured or observed values in the traits of agricultural interest. The collection of all the measured and observed values in the traits of interest are referred to as _phenotype_. The phenotype is influenced by different factors. These factors can be grouped into the following two categories. 

1. genetic factors ($G$)
2. environmental factors ($E$)

This dependence is often stated by the following identity 

$$P = G + E$$

That means the phenotype can be decomposed into a genetic part ($G$) and into an environmental part ($E$). The genetic part ($G$) is often referred to as _genotype_. The parametrization of the above shown decomposition of the phenotye is as such that the environmental component is defined as a deviation. That means the genotypic value of an animal with a certain genotype $G$ is defined as the average phenotypic value if that animal would have observations in very many environments. At this point, we have to note that absolutely no interactions between the components $G$ and $E$ are assumed. Hence the above shown identity assumes that the components $G$ and $E$ have a strictly additive effect on the phenotype $P$. 


## Decomposition of $G$
For a better understanding of the process of how properties, characteristics and traits are passed from parents to offspring, the genetic component $G$ must be further decomposed. Most livestock animals are diploids meaning that most of the cells carry pairs of chromosomes with corresponding loci. Each locus (also referred to as _gene_) has two possibly different forms called _alleles_. The two alleles were inherited one from the dam and one from the sire. The different alleles may have different effects on the phenotypic value. 

Linear regression is commonly used to estimate the effect of one quantity on another one. The allele content $N$ is defined as the number of copies of the minor allele with a positive effect at locus $i$ in the genome of an animal. For diploid organisms $N \in \{0,1,2\}$. The regression of the genotypic value $G$ of locus $i$ onto the allele content $N$ can be written as

\{__TODO__: Clear the following regression and make it specific for a given genotype \}

\begin{equation}
G = \mu_{G} + \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha\ N_{j} + \delta
(\#eq:decompgeno)
\end{equation}

where $\mu_G$ is the mean genotypic value in the population, $n$ is the number of alleles^[The meaning of then number of alleles $n$ corresponds to the number of individuals in the population, because the number of alleles at a locus in a given individual is $N_j$], $\alpha$ is the slope of the predictor $N_i$ corresponding to the number of minor alleles in individual $i$ and $\delta$ is the residual error^[The decomposition in \@ref(eq:decompgeno) is comparable to the decomposition of the genotypic value into population mean, breeding value and dominance deviation.].

The slope $\alpha$ is denoted as the _additive genetic effect_ of the minor allele at locus $i$^[The meaning of the term "allele $i$" is most likely, the minor allele with a positive effect at locus $i$.].
