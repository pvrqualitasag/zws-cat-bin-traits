  abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the pa- rameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We de- scribe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Henderson, Ir Department of Hunzan Development and Family Studies, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, U.S.A. S UMMARY The model generally considered in analysis of covariance has all levels of classification factors and interactions fixed, and also covariate regression coefficients fixed. Mixed models are more approp- riate in most applications. A summary of estimation and hypothesis testing for analysis of covariance in the mixed model, including the case of random regression coefficients, is presented. Higher-level covariate regressions (i.e., regressions in which, for all levels of a factor or interaction, all observations on the same level have a common covariate value) are discussed. Nonestimability problems that result from defining such covariates at the levels of fixed effects are illustrated. The case of nonhomogeneous covariate regressions in the mixed model is considered in the context of interpreting predicted future differences among levels of a given factor or interaction. Nonhomogeneous regressions complicate interpretations only when they are associated with the contrast(s) of interest among fixed effects in the model. The question of whether the regressions are homogeneous is itself often of substantive interest. Different random regression coefficients associated with the levels of a random effect are also examined.},

  abstract = {Inferences about genetic and residual correlation estimates and sire evaluations involving a categorical trait with linear model are ambiguous and mostly based on data simulations. In this study, estimates of variance components and prediction of breeding values in a model with a categorical and a continuous trait were compared between threshold-linear (TLM) and linear-linear models (LLM) in analysis of large clinical mastitis (CM) field data. Data on CM, somatic cell score (SCS), 305-day milk (MY), protein (PY) and fat yield (FY) from first-lactation Finnish Ayrshire cows were used. Four bivariate analyses were made using a TLM in Bayesian analysis. Each analysis fitted CM and one continuous trait at a time. Corresponding bivariate analyses were made using a Gaussian linear model. Estimates of heritabilities for CM were 0.06 and 0.02 from TLM and LLM, respectively whilst heritability estimates of the continuous traits were similar from both models. Genetic correlations between CM-SCS, CM-MY, CM-PY, and CM-FY from TLM and LLM were 0.63 and 0.63; 0.36 and 0.36; 0.32 and 0.32; 0.30 and 0.29, respectively. Estimates of residual correlations were 0.11 and 0.06; - 0.04 and - 0.02; - 0.03 and - 0.02; - 0.05 and - 0.03 between CM-SCS, CM-MY, CM-PY, and CM-FY, respectively. Comparison between the models indicates similar estimates of genetic correlations with no underestimation with the linear model analysis. In CM evaluation, the comparison of model's predictive ability showed greater improvements in accuracy with the bivariate than with the univariate models. There was, however no clear advantage of univariate threshold model over univariate linear model, except for less accuracy sires. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Fitness and fertility traits of dairy cattle are of increasing importance and are often measured on a discrete scale. The development and application of generalized linear mixed models to the genetic analysis of these traits are reviewed. Because current genetic evaluation systems are predominantly based on animal models, the inferential challenges of highly parameterized generalized linear mixed models are discussed. Development and adoption of new methods for drawing appropriate inferences on dispersion parameters are essential. Recent hierarchical extensions have been proposed for generalized linear mixed models, allowing for complex dispersion patterns that accommodate heteroscedasticity and outlier robustness. Steady advances in available computing power have facilitated multiple-trait analyses involving continuous and discrete measures. Full Bayesian inference via the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods will continue to allow even greater generality and dimensions in the genetic model.},

@Article{Vazquez2009,
  abstract = {Clinical mastitis is typically coded as presence/absence during some period of exposure, and records are analyzed with linear or binary data models. Because presence includes cows with multiple episodes, there is loss of information when a count is treated as a binary response. The Poisson model is designed for counting random variables, and although it is used extensively in epidemiology of mastitis, it has rarely been used for studying the genetics of mastitis. Many models have been proposed for genetic analysis of mastitis, but they have not been formally compared. The main goal of this study was to compare linear (Gaussian), Bernoulli (with logit link), and Poisson models for the purpose of genetic evaluation of sires for mastitis in dairy cattle. The response variables were clinical mastitis (CM; 0, 1) and number of CM cases (NCM; 0, 1, 2, ..). Data consisted of records on 36,178 first-lactation daughters of 245 Norwegian Red sires distributed over 5,286 herds. Predictive ability of models was assessed via a 3-fold cross-validation using mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) as the end-point. Between-sire variance estimates for NCM were 0.065 in Poisson and 0.007 in the linear model. For CM the between-sire variance was 0.093 in logit and 0.003 in the linear model. The ratio between herd and sire variances for the models with NCM response was 4.6 and 3.5 for Poisson and linear, respectively, and for model for CM was 3.7 in both logit and linear models. The MSEP for all cows was similar. However, within healthy animals, MSEP was 0.085 (Poisson), 0.090 (linear for NCM), 0.053 (logit), and 0.056 (linear for CM). For mastitic animals the MSEP values were 1.206 (Poisson), 1.185 (linear for NCM response), 1.333 (logit), and 1.319 (linear for CM response). The models for count variables had a better performance when predicting diseased animals and also had a similar performance between them. Logit and linear models for CM had better predictive ability for healthy cows and had a similar performance between them.},

  abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to estimate heritabilities for different types of claw and foot disorders and the genetic relationship of disorders with milk yield and selected conformation traits by applying logistic models in Holstein dairy cattle. The study included data from 5634 Holstein cows kept on large-scale dairy farms in Eastern Germany. Dichotomous response variables were the presence or absence of the disorder in 2003. Cows that were present in herds for {\textless}6 wk in 2003 were excluded from the analysis. Incidences, disregarding repeated measurements, for digital dermatitis (DD), sole ulceration (SU), wall disorder (WD), and interdigital hyperplasia (IH) in rear legs were 13.2, 16.1, 9.6, and 6.3{\%}, respectively. The herd effect was highly significant for all disorders. Incidences increased with increasing parities for SU and WD, but were highest among heifers for DD. High milk yield at the first 2 test d after calving was associated with a greater risk for claw and foot disorders in the same lactation. Estimates of heritability were 0.073 for DD, 0.086 for SU, 0.104 for WD, and 0.115 for IH. Genetically, health problems appear to occur in clusters (i.e., a cow showing one disease has an increased genetic risk of showing another claw disease). This phenomenon was also observed between claw and foot disorders and the somatic cell score. Genetic correlations between milk yield in early lactation and disorders were 0.240 for DD, 0.057 for SU, 0.270 for WD, and 0.336 for IH, indicating a physiological antagonism. Correlations between breeding values for claw and foot disorders of bulls and official breeding values for functional type traits were mostly favorable. Routine recording of claw data will offer a new chance to improve claw health within the population as was elaborated by different scenarios applying selection index procedures. {\textcopyright} American Dairy Science Association, 2005.},
